<!-- title: NYU Visit -->

Last night, arrived in NYC by bus, met my friend Benjamin Chan for Indian food around 9pm. Decamped to his place at "the House" on Roosevelt Island. Slept on his too-short couch, which worked, barely. (My feet went on the coffee table.)

Went over my slides one more time, then had a leisurely breakfast with Ben (made-to-order omelettes!). Showered and put on my khakis and blazer. 5 min meditation, and I was off on the F Train to NYU's Warren Weaver building on 55th where my talk was scheduled for 11am. There 45 minutes early, I convinced the security guard to let me in prior to my host's arrival, and set myself up in the seminar room.

Professor Chris Musco, my host, arrived 15 minutes before 11 and we had a good conversation. He'd seen on my website I'd been at Jane Street--apparently he runs a high school math competition every year, and the finals are held at the Jane Street offices.

I'd been nervous all of yesterday about the talk, partially because I have some kind of mental block for rehearsing talks. I am currently simply incapable of giving a talk to the mirror exactly how I'd give it to the audience, without stopping and trying to improve things. This is a fascinating issue and one I'm actively looking to fix. But in any case, my fears were ill-placed. My work on the slides and reviewing all the details of the algorithm and related work paid off, and I gave the best rendition of the talk yet. Watching Bill Kuszmaul give his Cornell job talk had inspired me to give the talk a bit more emotional/historical richness. And having the extra slides explaining Fiat-Naor meant that I got more detailed questions and was able to show off my deep understanding of the problem a bit. (Also, one thing I should include in the next version of the paper; probably log(N)-wise independent hash functions should suffice to run the non-adaptive algorithm.)

After the talk, lunch was enjoined; fresh bagel sandwiches! I talked with Chris and another professor Richard Cole a little bit, and then sat down with a roast beef sandwich. Talked a while with a young woman [Nikki Sigurdson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikkisigurdson) who had just finished her PhD and now was working at a crypto company called ChainCode. Apparently it's actually a non-profit R&D thingy anonymously backed by retired financiers? Very confusing, slightly sus. But she was bullish about doing cryptography-related stuff in industry. She said a big part of her job was just explaining cryptography concepts to her coworkers. After that, I joined some of Chris's PhD students, who were talking about some numerical linear algebra stuff. Got coffee with Chris and his students, then walked to another NYU building 15 mins away. Went up to the 6th floor and played some ping pong!
