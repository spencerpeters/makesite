In front of me, the empty page. Timeless dilemma. But time is short, even though the day is long.
I want to write, to try to explain what I know, and poke at the edges of my understanding.
I want to write like a tortoise.
The tortoise versus the hare: a quick refresher. The hare looks for a shortcut, a cheat code, an opportunity, and aims to exploit it for a burst of energy (cash, recognition) that lets him repeat the cycle on a higher level. The tortoise, on the other hand, goes in for incremental growth and the long game, mostly ignoring near-term wins and losses and opportunities except inasmuch as he finds them entertaining.
It is hard to write like a tortoise, unless you're writing a textbook or something.
The hare has much of interest to write about--new opportunities and tempting potential shortcuts arise every day and must be considered and discussed. To the extent that he will need to sell others on the opportunity to make use of it (almost always), the opportunity must be presented to others in different ways, to find product-market fit, so to speak.
The tortoise's knowledge is encoded more implicitly, in his daily practice. It is harder to communicate, harder to separate from context, and less timely. Rather than being supported by facts and figures, it is often supported mainly by personal experience. It takes time and effort to argue for.


That said, the tortoise's experience and time-tested principles yield strong intuitions that enable him to stake out a position on first principles.
