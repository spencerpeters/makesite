I've seen so much
Gone so far
Foggy fields of Ferndale fading from my memory

I've seen so much
Gone so far
Born to rage
But still I moved haphazardly
Not knowing what I'd see
When will I arrive as if I meant to be?

THIS IS MY MOMENT
EVERY MOMENT
Born to rage
Never waste a second of it

I left Park Day 7 years ago
And I only made Halifax yesterday
Horcruxes and half-pursued dreams
Strew the path from here back to that me

Still I am antifragile
And thank what gods may be
For my unconquerable soul
Oh the humanity I've learned to live among
The lives I learned to share
Training my mind and body
Letting stress drain from me
And energy arise from the wings of the butterfly

BORN TO RAGE
I can scarcely sit still
Despite myself, caught in the eye of the storm
Not all hustle is porn
Can I focus myself like sunlight through a glass
Etch my designs into the silicon
And let the world compute for me?

I left Park Day 7 years ago
And I only made Halifax yesterday
Horcruxes and half-pursued dreams
Sture the path from here back to me
But a thousand positive externalities
Grow like flowers at the edges of the road
And the journey as epic as any I imagined
Luck brought me here
Now it's time to make some of my own

I dreamed of ruling empires
I still dream of ruling empires
Perhaps now I know how to walk along the grain
To make the impossible inevitable
To arrive as though I'd meant to be
We will see
I just arrived in Halifax yesterday
